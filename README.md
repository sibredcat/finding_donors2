Investigated factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made based on real census data. Developed a naive classifier 
to compare testing results to. Trained and tested several supervised machine learning models on preprocessed census data to predict the 
likelihood of donations. Selected the best model based on accuracy, a modified F-scoring metric, and algorithm efficiency.
